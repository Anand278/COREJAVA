/*
	39.	Create class Product with three data members (pid, price, quantity) and 
	parameterized constructor that takes values for all three data members.  
	Create a main method in different class (say ProductDemo) and perform following task:
	a. Accept information for five Product objects from user and store objects in an array
	b. Find pid of product with highest price. 
	c. Create a static method (with array of productâ€™s object as argument) in Product class to calculate and
	return total amount spent on all products. 
	( amount spent on single product = price of product * quantity of product )
